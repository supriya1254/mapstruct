Mapstruct 
I always follow 3 principle of learning.
Why? What? How?

What is it?
It is a library, can generate bean mapper classes automatically.

Why do we need it ?
A lot of boilerplate code converting POJOs to other POJOs. so that we can avoid writing it while coding our main functionality.

Pre-requisite :

Need to add dependency
annotationProcessorPaths section which will use to generate the mapper implementation during build.

Remember :

An instance of the interface implementation can be retrieved from the Mappers class.
For example :
 private SimpleSourceDestination destination = Mappers.getMapper(SimpleSourceDestination.class);

Note: to use spring IOC in our mapper then we need to annotate your interface with this annotation.
@Mapper(componentModel = “spring”)
